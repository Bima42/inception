This project is an introduction to Docker. You will find here some docs concerning Docker.

## Docker
It's an open source containerization platform.
Enables developers to package applications into containersâ€”standardized executable components combining application source code with the operating system (OS) libraries and dependencies required to run that code in any environment.
Based on LCX (LinuX Containers).
Docker was created to address the portability and efficiency issues of virtual machines.
